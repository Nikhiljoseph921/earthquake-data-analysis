📌 About
This project processes raw seismic event data into a clean, well-structured dataset. It identifies key patterns in earthquake activity worldwide, with a focus on pinpointing regions with the most frequent events. The analysis results are showcased through interactive visualizations and deployed as a Shiny Python web application.

🧹 Data Cleaning
Loaded raw earthquake data from the official API

Performed data type corrections and handled missing values

Removed irrelevant columns while preserving all rows

Saved cleaned data for further analysis

🔎 Insights
Identification of the local geographical area with the highest seismic activity

Magnitude distribution analysis

Temporal trends over the study timeframe

Depth vs magnitude correlation

Frequency of seismic events by region

📊 Visualizations
Visual insights are created using Plotly Express and include:

Interactive maps of earthquake locations

Histograms of magnitudes

Time series charts of seismic event frequency

Scatter plots showing depth vs magnitude

Region-wise activity bar charts
