Earthquake Data Analysis & Visualization
Project Overview
This project analyzes global earthquake data from the last 30 days, aiming to uncover meaningful insights and visualize seismic activity patterns. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and interactive visualization, culminating in a deployed Shiny web application.

Contents
quakes-clean.ipynb — Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare a tidy and usable dataset.

quakes-insights.ipynb — Analytical notebook identifying key insights, including the region with the highest seismic activity.

quakes-plots.ipynb — Visualizations created using Plotly Express to illustrate the insights clearly.

Shiny App — An interactive web application built with Shiny for Python, deployed on Shiny’s cloud platform to showcase visualizations.

Features
Cleans and preprocesses raw earthquake data without removing rows, ensuring data integrity.

Performs detailed analysis using pandas to extract five key insights on seismic activity.

Visualizes data trends with interactive Plotly graphs.

Deploys an accessible web app to share findings dynamically.
